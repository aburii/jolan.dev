# The 'Universe' explained

:br

Here is an introduction on *what is the Universe*, this question might very simple and you probably said "duh" reading this line.

:br

But the question underlying this one is ***"What am I?"***

:br

And to be honest, I don't even know the answer besides "a young software engineer". That is why I decided to make a whole part about my hobbies, what's driving me and some blog posts. Hoping this will help you and me to understand what am I.

:br

To give you some context, as I am writing these lines I just graduated and therefore my student life is taking an end. I guess we all felt weird, relief, or lost. In this whole blog thing I'll try to cover my whole journey as a software engineer and give it a human taste.

:br

If you do, enjoy the reading,
